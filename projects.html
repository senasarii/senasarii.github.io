        <h2>Drew Gardens: A Secret Oasis in the Bronx</h2>
        <h2>My documentary project focuses on Drew Gardens in the Bronx, a vibrant community garden maintained by dedicated volunteers.  From farmers markets to other volunteering events this oasis stands out in the urban landscape of the Bronx, offering a serene escape to the local community. The heart of the documentary lies in the stories of these volunteers. Their unwavering passion and commitment to the garden are truly inspiring, especially considering their volunteer status. During our interviews, it became evident that each volunteer has a unique and personal connection to the garden. Their stories are not just about gardening; they reflect a deep-seated dedication to enhancing their community.
            <br>
            The project aims to showcase these personal narratives and underscore the garden's vital role in the Bronx community. It's a celebration of communal spirit, serving as a testament to the power of collective efforts in creating a green haven amidst the urban life. Our approach involved capturing the beauty and significance of the garden through interviews and footage from both the garden and the Bronx River. The production was a collaborative effort with my group members, Gabriella Price and Moira Minnich, while I handled the editing. I hope you enjoy it!
